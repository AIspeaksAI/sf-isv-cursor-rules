## üìñ Rule Details

### üèóÔ∏è Development Principles

All rules enforce these core principles:

1. **Source-Driven Development**: Git is the single source of truth, not the org
2. **Salesforce DX Tooling**: All operations use Salesforce CLI
3. **Scratch Org Strategy**: Temporary, disposable development environments
4. **Dev Hub Management**: Centralized package and org management

### üîí Security & Quality Standards

- **Code Obfuscation**: Managed package IP protection
- **API Design**: Minimal global exposure, namespace-accessible patterns  
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive testing requirements
- **Dependency Management**: Declarative package dependencies

### üöÄ Packaging Strategy

- **Modular Architecture**: Small, focused, interdependent packages
- **Shared Namespace**: Efficient code sharing across packages
- **Semantic Versioning**: `major.minor.patch.build` format with `NEXT` keyword
- **Ancestor Tracking**: `HIGHEST` keyword for upgrade path management
